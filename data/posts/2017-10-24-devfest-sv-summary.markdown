It's been a while since [GDG DevFest Silicon Valley 2016](https://devfest2016.gdgsv.com). It was a great success we hope repeat it very soon.

A BIG THANK to all the volunteers for their priceless help,  thanks to all the speakers for the great presentations and sharing their experience and knowledge, and, of course, thanks to [Google](https://www.google.com)

The event took place on the 21st of November at the Google Campus. Devfest was focused on Android, Web and Cloud technologies and also Community Hub. Over 300 people participated in the event with a mix of students and working professionals.

**A day full of discoveries:**

* 2 parallel tracks of Android, Web and Cloud technologies and also community hub.
* Around 26 sessions. No marketing - just technical hardcore!
* An awesome group of [speakers](https://devfest2016.gdgsv.com/speakers) (many of them were [GDE](https://developers.google.com/experts/))

* An informative 2 hour workshop that gave attendees an overview of Cloud DataProc and Big Table by [S. P. T. Krishnan](https://twitter.com/sptkrishnan).

The day ended with [Josh Gordon](https://twitter.com/random_forests) and an intro to TensorFlow

Thank you all!! You are awesome! Keep in touch with us!

Cheers - your DevFest West 2017 team ;)
